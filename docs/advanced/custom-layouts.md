# Custom Layouts

The custom layout feature in OverKeys allows you to use your own keyboard layouts defined in a configuration file. This is particularly useful for users who need:

- Specialized layouts not included in the default options
- Custom symbol or function key arrangements
- Language-specific layouts
- Modified versions of standard layouts

## Setup Instructions

### Turning the setting on

1. Open OverKeys
2. Right-click the OverKeys icon in the system tray
3. Select **Preferences**
4. Go to the **General** tab
5. Toggle the **Enable advanced settings** option
6. Toggle the **Use custom layout from config** option
7. Restart OverKeys if needed

### Using Configuration File

1. Right-click the OverKeys tray icon
2. Select **Preferences**
3. Go to the **General** tab
4. Click **Open Config**
5. In the JSON file, edit the `userLayouts` array and set the `defaultUserLayout` field:

   ```json
   {
   	"userLayouts": [
   		{
   			"name": "MyCustomLayout",
   			"keys": [
   				["`", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "=", "BSPC"],
   				["Q", "W", "E", "R", "T", "Y", "U", "I", "O", "P", "[", "]"],
   				["A", "S", "D", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", ";", "'"],
   				["Z", "X", "C", "V", "B", "N", "M", ",", ".", "/"],
   				[" "]
   			]
   		}
   	],
   	"defaultUserLa yout": "MyCustomLayout"
   }
   ```

6. Save the file
7. Toggle **Use custom layout from config** off then on again to apply changes

## Default User Layouts

OverKeys no longer comes with default/pre-configured layouts. Instead, you can find sample layouts in the example configuration file at [sample_config.json](../examples/sample_config.json), which includes:

- Extend (navigation and editing keys)
- Symbol (special characters and symbols)
- Arabic (Arabic language keyboard)
- Russian (Russian language keyboard)

You can copy these layouts from the sample configuration to get started with your own custom layouts.

## Creating Custom Layouts

You can create custom layouts by adding them to the `userLayouts` section in the configuration file. Each layout requires a unique name and a keys array that defines the layout structure:

```json
{
	"name": "MyCustomLayout",
	"keys": [
		// Top row (required)
		["`", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "=", "BSPC"],
		// Second row
		["Q", "W", "E", "R", "T", "Y", "U", "I", "O", "P", "[", "]"],
		// Third row
		["A", "S", "D", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", ";", "'"],
		// Fourth row
		["Z", "X", "C", "V", "B", "N", "M", ",", ".", "/"],
		// Fifth row
		[" "]
	]
}
```

You can then set this layout as your default by updating the `defaultUserLayout` field:

```json
{
	"defaultUserLayout": "MyCustomLayout"
}
```

## Format Guidelines

1. **Key Names**: Use standard key symbols or their aliases as defined in the system. For key names and their aliases, see [Supported Keys](../advanced/supported-keys.md).
2. **Layout Structure**: Each row should be defined as an array of keys. At minimum, a layout must have a top row defined.
3. **Language Support**: Unicode characters are supported for international layouts but is only recommended for use on [alternative layouts](../advanced/alternative-layouts.md) as key press state of these characters won't be detected
4. **Flexible Row Lengths**: Your custom layout doesn't need to follow standard row lengths. You can create layouts of any dimension. Here's an example of a compact 4×4 layout:

   ```json
   {
   	"name": "Compact4x4",
   	"keys": [
   		[""], // Mandatory top row, show top row setting turned off
   		["1", "2", "3", "A"],
   		["4", "5", "6", "B"],
   		["7", "8", "9", "C"],
   		["*", "0", "#", "D"]
   	]
   }
   ```

## Row Length Guidelines

While you have flexibility in defining your layout dimensions, the following row lengths are recommended to ensure compatibility across different key styles and visual presentations:

- Top row: 14 keys (including backspace)
- Second row: 12 keys
- Third row: 11 keys
- Fourth row: 10 keys
- Bottom row: 1 key (space bar)

Following these recommendations will help ensure your custom layout displays correctly with different keymap styles in OverKeys.

## Implementation Notes

- Custom layouts are loaded when OverKeys starts or when you toggle the setting.
- If the Kanata integration is enabled, your custom layout will be used as the base layout/layer, and Kanata will control layer switching.
- Custom layouts can be used simultaneously with the alternative layout feature.
- Custom layouts with names identical to the natively supported layouts will override the native ones.

## Troubleshooting

- If your layout displays incorrectly, verify the JSON format in your configuration file.
- Ensure your layout name in `defaultUserLayout` exactly matches one of the names in your `userLayouts` array.
- If you're using symbols or special characters, make sure they're properly escaped in the JSON.
